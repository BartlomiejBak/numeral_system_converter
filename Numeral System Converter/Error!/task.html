<p>What if someone enters a wrong radix?</p>

<p>And if the inputted number is impossible in the given radix?</p>

<p>Number is not a number?</p>

<p>Let's handle errors like this. For now, you are able to implement this without a <code class="java">try catch</code> construction. Use the rule: if you can avoid exception-based logic, avoid it!</p>

<p>So, you need toÂ implement error messages when the input is wrong to protect your program.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">How to submit?</h2>

<p>This stage is auto-graded. The grader will input some data. Then it will check that the last line of your program output contains "error" word if the input has been wrong.</p>

<p>If the input is correct, your program should behave as in the previous stage.</p>
